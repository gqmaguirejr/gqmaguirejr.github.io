<h3>Forms in the era of Web 2.0</h3>

<p>This project involve with a working title of Web 2.0 and forms. Today there are large number of forms that people fill out via a web browser. Frequently there is repetitive information name, address, etc. - and there are web plugs which can facilitate automatically filling in this information using macros (see for example, 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autofill-forms/">
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autofill-forms/</a>

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/">
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/</a>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/autofill-262804/">
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/autofill-262804/</a>

). As a large number of these forms contain sensitive information the connection to the web server is generally protected by TLS/SSL.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a need to take data that is available from one web server and place it into another web server - despite the fact that the two systems where not designed with an direct interface - hence the user often has to manually cut and paste information from one system to the other.</p>

<p>Today cross-site scripting is generally viewed as a means for attacks (see for example, 
<a href=".c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100411-Emmanouil-Karamanos-with-cover.pdf">
http://peope.kth.se/~maguire/.c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100411-Emmanouil-Karamanos-with-cover.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>There is a need for a web browser plugin or extension that could enable a user in a controlled fashion to minimize the amount of data that has to be repeatedly entered - ideally, the user should only have to enter the information once and it would go to all of the places that it needs to be.</p>

<p>For an example of a web browser plugin that takes functionality of
existing code and makes it available to the user via a web interface,
see the announcement for the thesis by Arun Arumugam Mathivanan.</p>

<p>This project will require some programming and a lot of knowledge about the communications between the web client and web server as well as between different components of the web client (and possibly other programs and scripts external to the web client that can gather information).</p>

<p>You might want to read about other technology, such as MozRepl - that is a plugin that give you access inside the Firefox browser.</p>



<h3>Secure context aware SIP user agent</h3>

<p>This thesis project concerns the design, implementation, and
evaluation of a context aware SIP user agent which can provide secure
multimedia VoIP calls and presence information. For example, it should
enable users to make use of multimedia (and perhaps other) devices
around them. For example, the user should be able to send the video
stream to a network attached data projector or large screen display;
while sending the audio to a network attached speaker; while providing
outgoing video images of an artifact in from of them via a network
attached camera -- with all of the streams being managed by the user's
device.</p>

<p>This project builds upon several previous thesis projects in this
area.  Based upon this earlier work, one of the important protcols is
the Service Location Protocol (SLP). It is important to understand
just how much of this protocol is needed on constrained devices to
support dynamic service discovery and to identify an efficient
mechanism to establish trust relationships between the user's device
and devices located near the user.</p>

<p>A goal is to minimize the effort required by the user to make used
of these nearby devices while protecting the user and their device
from "rogue" device. Thus to move the video from your handset (the
user's personal device) to a large display and the audio from your
headphones to speaker in the room and the reverse is not simply
redirection of the media stream, but knowing <em>when</em> and
<em>when not</em> to do so.  Using context aware device aggregation
the user should be able to make use of the devices around them as they
wish they could -- while minimizing the effort of the user (i.e., the
user should not have to spend their life configuring their
device(s)).</p>

<p>Note: There is one student already involved in this project.
There is room in this project for additional students.</p>

<h3>Adding SRTP and MIKEY to a SIP stack on a Symbian smartphone</h3>

<p>One of the projects that I would like to see done is a port of <a
href="http://www.minisip.org/">minisip</a> to the Symbian platform
(which has a SIP and RTP implementation), but has not implemented SRTP and
MIKEY. I think that this would be a very interesting system from both
a theoretical point of view (in how to integrated this with the
existing stack - for which I have some ideas) and from a practical
point of view as there have not been SRTP and MIKEY implementations in
handsets. (Contrast with the multiple device below in "Secure personal telephony gateway #2".)</p>

<h3>Applying network traffic shaping to I/O traffic shaping</h3>

<p>Based on a recent project looking at the limits of cloud computing
and there are some interesting aspects of applying techniques from
traffic shaping of network traffic to traffic shaping of file I/O.
See: <a href="http://people.kth.se/~maguire/.c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/101118-Victor_Delgado-with-cover.pdf">Victor
Delgado</a>, Exploring the limits of cloud computing,  Masters thesis, 
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), School of Information and Communications
Technology, TRITA-ICT-EX-2010:277, November 2010</p>

<h3>Peer-to-peer - for content distribution as a means of traffic
shaping over longer timescales</h3>

<p>The is also an interest in exploiting set top boxes with storage to provide peer-to-peer video content distribution, see for example: 
<a href="http://people.kth.se/~maguire/.c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/00824-Dario_Vodopivec-with-cover.pdf">
Dario Vodopivec</a>,

Delivery for Television Content Providers, Masters thesis, 
Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), School of Information and Communications
Technology, TRITA-ICT-EX-2010:211, August 2010</li>.
This can be seen as a way to exploit traffic shaping on a longer time
scale.</p>


<h3>The impact of Haptic applications on networks</h3>

<p>A growing area of research is haptic (tactile) interaction. It has
been shown that use of haptic feedback can improve the performance of
users when doing tasks such as filling out spreadsheets and defining
regions of interest for radiation therapy treatment
planning. Additionally, haptic interaction is often a part of
tele-surgery. Traditionally these systems used low delay, high
reliability links. A research question is to character the impact of
delay and delay variance on haptic applications (perhaps in a simlar
way to the R. G. Cole and J. H. Rosenbluth modeled the effect of delay
on voice over IP performance).</p>

<p>Note that this thesis project would probably interact with the
following thesis project.</p>

<h3>Haptic Feedback Forces Applied to Radiation Treatment Planning -
an Exjobb Proposal (together with researchers at the Karolinksa)</h3>

<p>For children who are receiving radiation therapy for cancer, it is
very important that the organ contours used for the radiation
treatment plan be as accurate as possible. In children, the organs are
reduced in size, making the task of defining such organ contours more
difficult than for an adult. The goal of this project is to increase
the accuracy of this contour definition process (the  task ) while not
increasing the time required for the task. Reducing the required time
required to perform this task would be an added benefit.</p>

<p>The haptic device is capable of producing several different kinds
of force: spring loading, viscous, direct, frictional, and hard
surface. The 3D visualization software can compute functions over the
pixels or voxels, to, for example, define edges using several
different filters. At present, the software implements a gradient
force. The haptic force produced from this gradient can be used as is
or can be modified by an exponential. Additionally, either of these
can be combined with a viscous force based on the velocity and
direction of the haptic device movement. This existing version has
been shown (in an earlier exjobb) to reduce the time required to draw
a contour, although the number of volunteers was not sufficiently
large to indicate if there was a statistically significant difference
in the accuracy, there was a significant reduction in the time
required.</p>

<p>This exjobb will (1) design an experiment which will use different
types of haptic forces, (2) conduct this experiment using a number of
volunteers, and (3) analyze the results to determine which gives the
best improvement with regard to accuracy and time in comparison with
the null hypothesis - i.e., without haptic force.</p>

<h3>Adding references via Zotero to Microsoft's PowerPoint and
OpenOffice's Impress</h3>

<p>Today many people utilize PowerPoint and Impress to create
presentation. However, oneo f the difficult aspects is providing
suitable citations to reference. This often requires a lot of manual
work.</p>

<p>Many people have found tha Zotero helps them keep track of there
reference and the extensions that are available for Microsoft's Word
and OpenOffice faciliate correctly citing these references in the
documents that they are writing?</p>

<p>It would be highly desirable to have a similar extension for
PowerPoint and Impress. Hnece the goal of this Bachelor's thesis
project is to create such an extension.</p>

<p>How could such an extension work?</p>

<p>Consider the case of PowerPoint. Extensions can be written in
Visual Basic. There are functions that will enable you to insert text
at a give point on a slide. There are also functions that will let you
store a string associated with a graphical object. These functions
have been used in 
<a href=www.technion.ac.il/~zvikabh/software/iguanatex/">
IguanaTex</a> to enable the user to enter an equation in
LaTeX format and have this automatically passed to LaTeX, rendered as
an image, and then include the image in the PowerPoint
presentation. However, the original LaTeX formala is also saved so
that it can be edited and re-rendered.</p>

<p>A similar approach could be taken to insert text that would
identify a specific Zotero reference. Then the extension would turn
this into a citation marker, such as the string [1]. Later in the
presentation would be a page of references, it would start with a
special marker that would indicate where the bibliogrpahy is to be
inserted. The extension would pass the list of references that have
been cite to Zotero to get a list of reference (with their number or
other marker) as a function of the citation style that has been selected.</p>

<p>For a team of two students, one student could create the extension
for PowerPoint and the other for Impress.</p>

<p>The first task in the project is to understand the communication
protocol between an extension and Zotero runing in Firefox. Basically
the extension sends request to Zotero and gets a response. The hard
work is also done by Zotero.</p>

<p>The second task is to understand how to add the citations and
bibliography to the document.</p>

<h3>Multicast filtering vs. workload</h3>

<p>
In Ymir Vigfusson, Hussam Abu-Libdeh, Mahesh Balakrishnan, Ken Birman,
Robert Burgess, Gregory Chockler, Haoyunan Li, and Yoav Tock,
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/i/pdf.jpg">
"Dr. Multicast: Rx for Data Center Communication Scalability"</a>,
Eurosys 2010 - the authors claim tha there is a tragedy of the commons
due to the limited availablity of IP multcast state space on network
interface and network switches (see their table 1) and that when
multiple applications are using multicasting that "filtering becomes
ineffective when a large number of groups are used, and this can
burden end-host kernels with high rates of unwanted traffic,
overwhelming receivers who in turn begin dropping packets."
</p>

<p>
While their paper uses sources from 2004 (their reference [15]) and
2008 (their reference [22]) for background. Their own experiments show
that with an increasing number of multicast groups that the packet
loss rate increases - despite the fact that the transmitted packet
rate was constant.
</p>

<p>The topic of this thesis project would be to perform the packet
loss experiments that they describe in their section 2.4 and plot in
their figrue 1 - in both a local setting (i.e., attached to a single
switch) and on a wide area basis (i.e., across multiple switches).
The later experiments might examine the impact on ISP's access
networks that are supporting multicast.
</p>


<h3>Secure personal telephony gateway</h3>

<p>Add support for a personal telephony gateway to <a
href="www.minisip.org">minisip</a> to create a secure personal
telephony gateway. Test this software using hardware based upon the
Tiger 560B telephony chip.</p>

<p>This is a project well suited to a pair of students, one with
knowledge of C++ (as minisip is implemented in C++) and the other with
knowledge of device drivers (as the hardware is attached via a USB
interface).</p>

<h3>Securing a personal telephony gateway</h3>

<p>Using an existing ATA device create a personal telephony gateway to
enable SRTP and improved security for customers using an ATA that does
<em>not</em> provide security.</p>

<p>Consider for example a Tilgin AB Vood 322 device + PC which could support
MIKEY and SRTP.</p>

<h3>IPv6 appliances</h3>

<p>IPv6 is seeing increasing use and is essential if "everything" is
going to be attached to the network. To further the goal of making
appliances, sensor, etc. as source, sinks, and sources+sinks - it is
essential that various devices become "network enabled". This series of
batchelors thesis projects concerns how to network enabled
appliances. There should be opportunities to work with students in the
IT Product Realization program, SOC, etc.</p>

<p>A first step in this area is the thesis:
Thor Hådén, <a href="http://people.kth.se/~maguire/.c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/090601-Thor_Haaden.pdf">
 IPv6 Home Automation</a>, Batchelors thesis, Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH), School of Information and Communications Technology,
TRITA-ICT-EX-2009:28, June 2009</p>

<h3>More than downloading</h3>

<p>Today many networks are optimized for downloading (i.e., a transfer
through the networking infrastructure to a host). Examples, include
web browsing, audio and video streaming from traditional media
providers, etc. One of the coming trends is increasing generation of
content (even if it is only a sensor saying "the temperature in the
basement has fallen below 8 degrees C"). This will result in
increasing amounts of traffic in the uplink direction. This series of
batchelors thesis projects concerns how to accelerate the growth in
the amount of uplink traffic. (Note that the links that we are
concerned with can be both wired and wireless.)</p>

<h3>Accelerating adoption of IPv6</h3>

<p>The last blocks of IPv4 addresses will likely be assigned this
year. This means that there will not be new addresses, this implies
either a partitioned network (where some parts of the network are
unreachable from other parts of the network) or a transition to IPv6.</p>

<p>The aim of this thesis project is to investigate and help users to
transition to IPv6. This thesis will need to address technical,
political, and economic issues to facilitate increasing IPv6 adoption
in Sweden. For example, this project might generate a set of short
articles - suitable for a newspaper - on how users can and should
transition to IPv6.</p>


<h3>Using RFIDs for context</h3>

<p>Given the user by SL of RFID cards there will be an increasing
number of users with RFID cards. An interesting question is: Can these
be used to provide an inexpensive source of context information? One
method to start to explore this is incorporating simple RFID readers
into mobile platforms. This project would involve adding a RFID reader
to a PDA to use the RFID card serial numbers as a source of context
information. Note that this project does not concern reading the
contents of the RFID card, but only reading card serial nunmbers.</p>

<p>This thesis can build on work of an earlier MS thesis:
