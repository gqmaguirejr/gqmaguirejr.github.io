<H1>Exjobbs associated with Prof. <A HREF="http://people.kth.se/~maguire">Gerald Q. "Chip" Maguire Jr.</A></H1>

<p><A NAME=GM>Prof. Gerald Maguire</A> &lt;<a href="mailto:maguire@kth.se">maguire@kth.se</A>&gt;
is an examiner for thesis projects (primarily) on: data communication,
mobile communication, personal communication, ... . Note that he
spends a <b>large</b> fraction of his teaching time supervising
exjobbs. For examples of past thesis projects, see the subset of
<a href=".c/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/index.html">theses</a>
for which he has been an examiner (see the list of the 
<a href="./Events/Old-Seminars">past
annoucements (1992-2015)</a> to see which theses he has been an
examiner for).</P>

<p>If you have been offered a thesis project (exjobb) in industry
which you think he might be the relevant academic advisor and examiner
for, then send the description of the proposed project to him via
e-mail -- <em>before</em> stating on the project. If you have an idea
of your own or are looking for an idea in an area which you think he
would be a suitable academic advisor and examiner, send him mail.</p>

<P>Students needing an "Intyg" for CSN should directly contact their study
adviser or the relevant administrative office (such as ICT's Student
Centrum (Studentcentrum)), as I <b>cannot</b> sign such documents.</P>

<p>Registration forms are available from your school/program. (See for
<a href="http://www.kth.se/student/2.2453/1.10933?l=en_UK">example</a>.)

<p>There is some useful information in the following two presentations
 the 23 of January 2009:
Ben Slimane's <a href="MSc_Procedures-20090123.pdf">presentation on procedures for exjobbs</a> and
G. Q. Maguire Jr,'s <a  href="Exjobb-talk-maguire-2009.pdf">Scientific
 method, Previous work, Literature study, Plagiarism, ...: Some useful tips for those doing a masters thesis project</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that all correspondence with me regarding your thesis
project should be done via <b>your KTH e-mail account</b>.</P>

<!-- In keeping with SDOC1235 all information which might identify students currently in the process of their exjobbs has been removed. -->

<!-- formerly at http://www.lib.kth.se/main/assets/files/pi/Ex-jobb_KTH.pdf -->
<p>In keeping with the
<a href="http://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.268289!/Menu/general/column-content/attachment/examensarbeten.pdf">
KTH policy regarding putting the final thesis in DiVA</a> -
I expect that all students that I am an examiner for will agree to put
the full text of their report on-line.</p>

<h2>New exjobbs with grading</H2>

<p>Since 1 July 2007, it is possible to have the following types of
exjobbs with a grade:<p>
<ul>
<li>Civilingenj&ouml;examensarbete - 30 hp as part of the Civilingenj&ouml;examen 300/270 hp program</li>
<li>Magisterexamensarbete - 30 hp as part of the Magisterexamen 120 hp program</li>
<li>Magisterexamensarbete - 15 hp as part of the Magisterexamen  60 hp program</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~akhog/information_till_studenterna.pdf">Information
for students</a> about the grading of exjobbs</p>

<p>For further information see the information about the specific
course, such as <a

<H2><A NAME=advice>Advice to every exjobb student</A></H2>

<p>My advice to all thesis project students is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not panic! There are lots of things that you will not know, but
you can learn them.</li>

<li>Get in the habit of writing. Try to write at least one page per
day. If you think of a question write it down. When you think of an
answer write it down. Once a week step back and look at the table of
contents for your thesis as you plan the next week's activities.</li>

<li>Write your draft titlepage and abstract - the first night of your
project. (This will help you keep your focus.)</li>

<li>Look at your table of contents at least once every week - as you plan your next
week. Avoid getting stuck in a local minima.</li>

<p>I encourage students to use <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> for
their reference management. Of course you can also use a commercial
tool or other tool. The key is that you should be using a tool to
facilitate working with your references and reference material. (For a
comparisons of difference systems see <ahref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software</a>.)
You can find examples of using Zotero in my II2202 lecture notes on
<a href="./courses/II2202/II2202-powertools-chip-20110827.pdf">
powertools</a> and 
<a href="./courses/II2202/Lecture7-Maguire-20130912.pdf">
Writing and Oral Presentations</a>.
I encourage you to use my Zotero style <a href="ExampleStyle-with-access.csl">
ExampleStyle-with-access.csl</a> as it provides a rather complete reference
(including DOI, ISBN, or URL where relevant). For those who want a
bibliographic style which is similar to IEEEtran, but with ISBNs,
DOIs, and URLs, see <a href="myIEEEtran.bst">myIEEEtran.bst</a>.</p>

<H2>Note about language(s)</H2>

<P>The thesis is generally written in Swedish or English. There must
be an abstract in <b>both</b> Swedish and English. Under certain
circumstances, and with the approval of the supervisor, the thesis may
be written in another language, but must still have abstracts in
<b>both</b> Swedish and English
(see "<a href="http://intra.kth.se/en/regelverk/policyer/sprakpolicy-for-kth-2010-1.60909">Language Policy for KTH 2010</a>",
Dnr V-2009-0365, doss 1, section 4.10: "Abstracts of dissertations and
theses "Every Master's dissertation, licenciate thesis and doctoral thesis
that is written in English is to include a Swedish Abstract. Similarly, 
every dissertation or thesis written in Swedish is to have an English
Abstract.").
A student may also have a version of the abstract in additional
languages. For example, students in double degree programs and
exchange programs may need to have a version of the abstract in the
language of their home instition.</P>

<h2>Notes about writing</h2>

<ul>
<li>For your document, you should be sure to use A4 sized paper rather than US letter.</li>
<li>Set the text in a serif font, such as Times Roman (as it is much
easier to read a lot of text when there are serifs). Also it is nice
to indent the first line of each paragraph by 2-3 ems (this is the
width of the letter "m" in the current font size). Also fill and
justify the paragraphs of the body of the report.</li>


<li>For those using LaTeX, you can improve the look of the document by:
  <ul><li>switching to using PostScipt fonts
          <A href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/psnfss/psnfss2e.pdf">(instructions)</A></li>
      <li>You can also turn off hyphenation or at least limit its use
          with "\hyphenpenalty=5000 \tolerance=1000"</li>
      <li>Manually break lines with \linebreak[1] - this will allow
          LaTeX to break the line while still justifying the text. The
	  numeric argument can be used to be more insistent about breaking the
	  line. Useful values are 1..4.</li>
      <li><a href="http://w2.syronex.com/jmr/w3c-biblio">BibTex entries</a> for W3C publications</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.tm.uka.de/~bless/bibrfcindex.html">BibTex entries</a> for RFCs</li>
      <li>IEEE and ACM provide BibTeX entires for their publcations
      via the web page for each publication</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/bytefield/bytefield.pdf">
          bytefield</a> package to draw packet structures</li>
      <li>Gilles Bertrand has some nice 
      <a href="http://perso.telecom-bretagne.eu/gillesbertrand/tutorials">LaTeX tutorials</a>, for example how
      to draw call flows using the xy package and      
      how to draw Markov chains.</li>
      <li>pcap2tex - see <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-users/201007/msg00258.html">
      http://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-users/201007/msg00258.html</a></li>
      <li>Rather than using numeric superscripts it is better to use
          <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/826/symbols-instead-of-numbers-as-footnote-markers">symbols</a></li>
      
    </ul></li>

<li>Another useful tool is <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>
- there are plugins for OpenOffice and  Microsoft's Word.</li>

<li>Read your document before submitting it - if you have unresolved
links, missing references, etc. fix them before submitting a draft</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some common flaws in theses</h2>

<UL>
<li>Incomplete references - see the references in the lecture notes
    for my course for examples of references</li>
<li>Missing important citations</li>
<li>Statements made without justification or supporting citations</li>
<li>Poor (or no) editing</li>
<li>Failure to spell check the document</li>
<li>Not checking grammar - see a tool such
  as <a href="https://www.grammarly.com‎">Grammarly</a> to help you.
  See also the <a href="https://sv.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writefull_Overleaf_Extension">Writefull
  Overleaf Extension</a></li>
<li>Documents where it is clear that no one looked at the document after formatting
- often these have breaks in the middle of sentences, missing phrases,
... .</li>

<li>Lack of page numbers</li>
<li>Unreadable text in figures</li>
<li>Failure to label elements of figures adequately</li>
<li>Use of contractions (Do not use contractions in a formal report.)</li>
<li>Use of acronyms or abbreviations without properly introducing
them; often failure to use these acronyms and abbreviations
consistently through the rest of the paper</li>
<li>Redundant text</li>
<li>Using figures from others without the copyright owner's permission</li>
<li>Using too few refences, so the paper looks like simply a cut and
paste edit of these references.</li>
<li>Single sentence paragraphs</li>
<li>Lack of vertical white space between paragraphs, which in some
cases makes it hard to understand where new paragraphs begin</li>
<li>Lack of a date - every document should have a date, in addition to title and author(s)</li>
<li>Lack of section, subsection, ... number - makes cross references difficult</li>
</UL>

<h2>Partial list of ways to fail a degree project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not writing in the thesis on a daily basis,</li>
<li>Not having a clear research methodology and a clear timeline,</li>
<li>Not in mind both the work within the company <em>and</em> the KTH requirements for the degree project,</li>
<li>Not giving enough priority to the thesis project, and</li>
<li>Trying to do too many things (i.e. loosing focus on the problem you are trying to solve).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thesis statistics</h2>


<p>Some interesting statistics about past theses:
<a href="length-over-time-1994-2019.png">Length (over time)</a>, <a href="histogram-1994-2019.png">Histogram of
lengths</a>, and <a href="CDF-1994-2019.png">CDF of lengths</a>.</p>
<p>For some statistics on distribution of thesis presentations over <a
href="Maguire-thesis-stats-plots-1994-to-20140303-20150630_Page_1.png">the
years, the year, the months, days of the months, days of week</a>, <a
href="Maguire-thesis-stats-plots-1994-to-20140303-20150630_Page_2.png">hour
of the day (when the oral examination started), and number of exams per day</a>. From these we can see that June and December
are the major months for presentations; there is a possibly small
cluster of days at the end of the month - but just about any day of
the month exams have occured; and Monday, Thursday, and Friday are the
most popular days for presentations. One can also see that except for
the low at noon and the peak at 13:00, the starting times are rather
spread over the day. Additionally, it is quite rare to have 3 or 4
exams on the same day, but about 1/3 of the examinations took place on
the same day as another exam.</p>

<h3>Abstracts</h3>

<p>Approximately 90% of all English language abstracts for theses examined by
prof. Maguire are between 200 and 450 words. Note that databases such
as ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses (PQDT)limit abstracts to 350
words. While Canada's National Archive limits Masters thesis abstracts
to 150 words (and Doctoral dissertation to 350 words). Chalmers
University of Technology suggests a Master's thesis abtract should be
between
<a href="https://student.portal.chalmers.se/en/chalmersstudies/masters-thesis/Pages/design-and-publish-masters-thesis.aspx">
250 and 350 words</a>.</p>

<p>At ICT, the median length of abstracts in number of paragraphs is 3
with a standard deviation of 1.9 paragraphs.</p>

<p>For a short description of how to write an abstract, see Philip Koopman,
<a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html">How to Write an Abstract</a>,
Essay, Carnegie Mellon University, October, 1997.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>Choosing good keywords can help others to locate your thesis and related theses.</p>

<p>When choosing keywords consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the most specific keyword from those used in your domain, see for example:
    <ul>
    <li>ACM's Computing Classification System (<a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/2012">2012</a>)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf">2013 IEEE Taxonomy Version 1.0 </a></li>
<!--    <li>UMI/ProQuest Subject Categories</li> -->
    </ul>
<li>If there is no existing keyword that is suitable, then considering introducing a
    keyowrd of your choice - but remember that doing so may make it harder
    for someone else to find your thesis. This will typically only be
    necessary when a new keyword comes into use due to the evolution
    of a field. [Note: Former IEEE Transactions on Antennas and
    Propagation Editor-in-Chief, L. Wilson Pearson, added only 
    <a href="http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~ieee_tap/Keyselect.php">150 new
    keywords in the 2-1/2 years he was editor</a>]</li>
<li>Think about what someone else would use as a keyword to find your
    thesis along with related theses from among millions of theses.</li>
<li>The first letter of a keyword should be set with a capital letter
    and proper names should be capitalized as usual.</li>
<li>Spell out acronyms and abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid "stop words" - as they generally carry little or no information.</li>
<li>List your keywords separated by commas (",").</li>
<li>Since you should have both English and Swedish keywords - you
    might think of ordering them in corresponding order (i.e., so that the
    n-th word in each list correspond) - thus it would be easier to
    mechanically find matching keywords. <em>Personally</em>, I think
    this paired ordering would be better than alphabetizing each list independently.</li>
</ul>

<p>A list of paired English-Swedish kewords used in theses at KTH as
of 2014.08.11 can be found <a href="KTH-keywords-20140814B-list-pairs-handedited.csv">here</a>
and the list of <a href="KTH-keywords-20140814B.xlsx"> keywords by
school</a> extracted from theses. Both of these sets of keywords have
been edited by hand to deal with problems in the actual set of
keywords stored in DiVA. For non-empty sets of keywords, the median
number of keywords is 5, with a minimum of 1, a maximum of 43
(English) 146 (Swedish), and a minimum and maximum standard deviation
ranging from 3 to 5. For this one can draw the conclusion that a
typical thesis should have 5-6 keywords (typical of the limited number
of keywards (4-10) many publications enforce).</p>


<h2><A NAME="Requiredreflections">Required reflections</a></H2>

<p>Each student is advised to write a section in their thesis to

Ordinance (1993:100) concerning <b>Values and attitudes</b>. The

<p><a href="https://www.uhr.se/en/start/laws-and-regulations/Laws-and-regulations/The-Higher-Education-Ordinance/">The
    Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100) (in English)</a> specifies the
requirements for the degrees in Sweden. Of particular relevance to
thesis project students is the following (translated from Swedish):</p>

<H3>Master of Science</h3>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<P>The Master of Science degree is awarded only after the student has
completed a specific program's course requirements for 300 credits.</P>


<h4>Target</h4>
<P>MSc students must demonstrate the knowledge and skills required to work independently as a civil engineer.</P>

<h4>Knowledge and understanding</h4>
<P>MSc students must:</P>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the chosen technology, the scientific basis 
and proven experience and insight into current research and development,
and</li>

<li>Demonstrate both broad knowledge in the chosen field of engineering,

economic aspects, environmental and social aspects, and</li>

<li>Demonstrate an ability to identify the need for further knowledge
and to continuously upgrade their skills.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Independent work (thesis)</h4>
<P>For the MSc degree, the student as part of their course of studies
must complete an independent project (degree project) worth at
least 30 credits.</P>

<p>For some examples of the "Required Reflections" section see the following theses:</p>

<h2><A NAME=oralpresentation>Exjobb oral presentation</a></h2>

<p>Typically each oral presentation (by one or two students) is a
total of 25 to 35 minutes long. This is followed by questions and
comments from the opponent(s). Next the audience has a chance to ask
questions about the thesis. Finally, the examiner will ask any final
questions that they have. A typical oral presentation and examination
lasts a total of &lt;1 hour.</p>

<p>A typical oral presentation addresses the following:
<ol>
<li>Title slide: Project title[:subtitle], Name of student(s) who
conducted the project, Date of the oral presentation, Where the
project was conducted, Name(s) of supervisor(s) and examiner(s).(1 slide)</li>
<li>Problem statement, Why the problem is important to solve, and your
Goals, problem context, delimitations, ... (1 or 2 slides)</li>
<li>Background and Related work (b slides)</li>
<li>Method used to solve the problem (m slides)</li>
<li>Results and Analysis (r slides)</li>
<li>Conclusion (1 or 2 slides)</li>
<li>Future work (1 or 2 slides)</li>
<li>Final slide - to solicit questions (1 slides)</li>
</ol>

<p>The typical number of slides will be less than ~30, hence b+m+r &lt;
25 slides. However, it is advisable to have backup slides (after your
"Final" slide) to show any figure/table/formula/... that your
audience is likely to ask about. Alternatively, you can have a
version of your thesis draft ready in a suitable viewer - so that you
can show any part of it that might be necessary to address any
questions that come up.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that only the opponent(s), supervisor(s), and
examiner(s) are likely to have read the who thesis beforehand - so you
need to present the key points of your thesis project in your oral
presentation at a level that the audience will be able to understand:
what was the problem, why was it important to solve, what others have
done, what you did, what you learned, and what should be done next.</p>


<p>Note that students are not allowed to use the KTH logo on their slides.</p>

<p>You should have a slide number on each of your slides (other than
the title slide) to help listeners take notes - so that they can
reference their questions to specific slides.<p>

<p>Avoid complex slide backgrounds and make sure that what you want
your audience to be able to see will be visible (this means avoiding
small fonts, yellow text/lines, ... ).</p>

<h2>Self-evaluation with respect to The Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100) goals</h2>

<p>If you want to do a self-evalutation of how well your thesis fulfills
the requirements for your educational requirements see the
<a href="Riktlinjer_bedomning_kvalitet_exjobb_cing_chalmers_with_English_translation-as-spreadsheet-20140610.xlsx">
spreadsheet</a>.
</P>


<h2><A NAME=oppositionreport>Exjobb opposition report</a></h2>

<p>Your primary goal as an opponent is to help the student improve
their thesis. A secondary goal is to help the student improve their
future oral presentations. Achieving both of these goals is based upon
providing feedback. There is a template for the opponent's report that
you should complete.  Generally you should begin your oral opposition
with what you liked about the oral presentation, then comment on what
could be improved. Following this you should ask the questions that
are still unclear after having read the thesis and after having heard
the student's oral presentation.  You should also have ~10 minutes of
questions for the student after their presentation in order to start
off the question and answer period. You can find a template and
examples of opponents reports below.</p>
