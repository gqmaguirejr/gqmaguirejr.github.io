``The problem here is that the kinds of research proposals demanded by
many funding agencies resemble business plans, especially in terms of
the detail required. Radical product innovation, by its very nature,
involves the exploration of "virgin" territory. It cannot be mapped
out and planned, except in a very general sense. If funding agencies
wish to encourage radical innovation, they should, like foundation,
support general concepts and people more that detailed proposals.''
</q>
<p>from pg. 29 in Chapter 1: A "Liberating Form" for Radical Product
Innovation, by Lee Tom Perry and Kurt W. Sandholtz, in the book
"Managing Technological Development", editors Urs E. Gattiker and
Laurie Larwood, published by Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1988, ISBN 3
11 011 084 9 and ISBN 0-89925-414-4.</A></p>

``Those who capture this computing power and the corresponding speed of
the information flow are
going to have a tremendous advantage. I don't care where you look in
the spectrum of warfare.
Throughout history, soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen have learned
one valuable lesson: If you
can analyze, act and assess faster than your opponent, you will win!''</q>

<P> In an article "Commentary: Bob Metcalfe Reports on ACM97", in
ACM's MEMBERNET, a supplement to Communications of the ACM, May 1997,
Vol. 40, No. 5, on pp. 1 and 8 Bob Metcalfe is ask:</P>

<q>
Q: What was the most important insight into the future of computing
presented at the conference?</q>

<q>
A: If I had to choose only one, it would  be telepresence. The killer
"app" for computing in the next 50 years seems to be as a replacement
for travel. Being some where telepresently by using networks and
computers will be better than being there physically. It's not only
that people won't suffer jet lag and won't have to spend time
traveling. Telepresence also will be better because groups of people
will be able to join together and their interactions will be enhanced
by computers. They'll be able to see each other, have side
conversations, have discussion moderated in a constructive fashion, in
addition to being able to access information and data on the spot."

"... The  true measure of the quality of research in Computer Science
and Engineering is:
<UL>
    <LI>Impact, not publications</LI>
    <LI>Conferences, not journals.</LI>
</UL>

CS research is ultimately concerned with creation of software. Thus,
the impact of the research can come from the software created within a
project, of from the ideas that directly influenced the creation of
software, as well as from scholarly publicatiopns about the
work. Historically, many of the greatest ideas in CS have been
disseminated through software packages. Howver, when one evaluates
research by publications there is a tendency for the support to go to
those researchers who prefer to write papres rather than to create
software. We heard form several investigators who expressed a distaste
for writing code -- not a good attidude for someone conducting -->

<Blockquote>
I spent my entire working life using physics to grub for paydirt in an
industrial setting. By this I do not mean the central research
laboraroty of a multibillion-dollar technological conglomerate able to
support "pure" curiosity -driven study. I mean the product development
laboratory of a nose-to-the-grindstone division engaged in a battle
for marget shae in a rather prosaic industry that nevertheless
depended on mastery of some complex and challenging technology. In
such as setting, any project that yielded only meeting presentations
or publications in referred journals had to be considered essentially
a failure.<br>
Academic collegaues, as well as those in central-research-laboratory
environments, have often expressed concern that such focused
investigations stife creativity and preclude followingup unexpected
discoveries. However, I never in my entire career had to write a
proposal for a government grant to get my work supported. Because (in
recent years) four proposals might have to be written to get one
grant, I conclude tht I have been spared an enormous drain on my
productivity that has at least partially compensated me for having to
take on a lot of mundane tasks. And, the curious thing is that many of
those mundane taks turned out on closer examination to involve some
interesting physics.<br>
In any case, I had fun, and I didn't feel my creativity was
particularily hobbled by the constraint of utility superposed on the
requirement of novelty. I did have the advantage that my area of study
was the technology of light sources, a field hitherto plowed primarily
by experiment. It was the lamp industry, after all, that gave the
the term "edisonian research" to the world of technology.<br>
