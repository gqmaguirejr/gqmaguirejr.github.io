<H1>NVIDIA Quadro FX 1000 cooling</H1>

<p>The fan cooling the NVIDIA Quadro FX 1000 in a Dell Precision 450
workstation failed. This card was a Dell Part# W0663 nVidia Quadro
FX1000 128Mb 8x AGP. It was possible to replace the fan with the
<a href="http://www.artic-cooling.com/">Artic Cooling</a> NV Silencer 6
(revision 2); although there is a ~1cm gap between the plastic of the
exhaust and the exit grill. This gap could be closed by the NV
Silencer 1 (revision 2) - which appears to be the correct version of
the product to use. However, the local store did not have one.
</p>

<p>The excellent
<a href="http://www.arctic-cooling.com/downloads/compatibility/height_restr_nv6_r2.pdf">drawings</a>
from Artic Cooling of their devices - show the height clearances and physical layout
very well. One specification which is left out is the actual position
of the mounting pins (labled mounting holes in the drawing) which
stick down from the cooler. When trying to decide which of their
coolers might fit the Quadro FX 1000 it would have been helpful to
know this. Note that this is clearly labeled in the case of the
<a href="http://www.arctic-cooling.com/downloads/compatibility/height_restr_nv1_r2.pdf">drawings</a>
for the NV Silencer 1 (revision 2) - which is listed as being
appropriate for the Quadro FX 1000. Unfortunately the local shop where
I could obtain parts did not have an NV Silencer 1 (revision 2) in
stock, but only had a NV Silencer 1 (without any version number
indicated). This particular device has 4 mounting screws in a square,
rather than two on a diagonal as in the case of the FX 1000 fan which
I was removing. It appears that the board had holes for both types of
mountings, but since it used the two holes on a diagonal for the
current fan and there were nice clearance marks on the board for the
small rubber spacers which are placed on the screw posts after they
come out the back of the board, I chose to use the NV Silencer 6
(revision 2) board.

Silencer.</p>

<h2>NVIDIA Quadro FX 1000 cooling fan</h2>

cooling unit.</P>

<p>Using a cross point 0x40 screw driver one can remove the five small
screws from the front of the cooling unit -
<A HREF="nvidia-front-inside.jpg">Front</A> internal view. The
<a href="nvidia-cover-plate.jpg">cover and screws</a>.</p>

<p>The power to the fan passes under a <a href="nvidia-plug2.jpg">rubber plug</a> on the side of the
heat sink, this can be easily removed with a pair of needle nose pliers.
After removing the rubber plug, the small fan can be easily removed, buy removing
<a href="nvidia-three-screws.jpg">three screws</a>. However, I am not
sure where one would find a replacement 12V DC 0.1A ~37mm fan.</p>

<p>After loosing the connectors which held the heat sink to the board
and removing this fan I used a hot air gun to heat the heatsink
and was able to remove the heatsink from the GPU chip. The chip was
cleaned off using a small knife.</p>

<p>It was easy to attach the Artic Cooling device following the
manufacturer's directions. It might also be worth noting that the
mounting bracket has to be placed on the back of the card such that it
is concave when the middle is placed against the board (i.e., the two
ends need to stick out farther than the middle). Otherwise the rubber
pad is not easily positioned and most importantly you don't get the
compression force that you are trying to achieve when you tighten the
screws.

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<ul>
<li>It might have been possible to simply replace only the fan itself
(see details on the fan above)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.devhardware.com/forums/nvidia-video-card-6/nvidia-quadro-fx-1000-heat-sink-removal-20289.html">Others</a>
have described removing the OEM heatsink and replace Zalman ZM80C Heat
Sink and ZM-OP1 Fan. Note that this same page discusses using 1,1,1
trichloroethane to clean off the GPU.</li>
