<TITLE>LPKF ProtoMat S42: removing Z-axis assembly with spindle motor</TITLE>
<H1>LPKF ProtoMat S42: removing Z-axis assembly with spindle motor</H1>

<p>At the end of June 2010 the collet was not holding in drill bits or mill
  tips. The initial suspicion was that there was dirt in the collet. After
  clearning with a very small (dental) brush - one of the 0.370mm drill bits
  would hold, but not tighly. Milling bits were not held at all.</p>


<p>Initially it appeared that the whole machine (43 kg) would have to be
shipped back for repair. However, the local distributor 
<a href="http://www.solectro.se">Solectro AB</a>
called on Friday 9 July
to say that we could simply remove the Z-axis head and ship that to them for
repair. So that afternoon I started to remove the acoustic cover to get to the milling
head. On Monday I got a note from Sven Ems at the LPKF factory with a nice guide
to removing the motor assembly block. This document is called "Exchanging the milling
spindle of the ProtoMat S 42" dated 2 July 2008. It had the file
name "PM_S42_Exchange-milling spindle - both versions-e.pdf"</p>

<p>This page attempts to describes what I did, but only for informational
  purposes. <em>It is only for use by those knowledgable in such repairs. Many
    of the pictures were taken out of order, but the description is hopefully clear.</em>
</p>

<p>I used a parts box with bins to place the various screws and other parts
  in as I removed them. Each bin was assigned a number of the for Bn, where n
  is an integer.</p>

<ol>
<li>The zeroth step was to turn off the power and disconnect the power cable from the
    ProtoMat S42.</li>

<li>Remove the 8 Torx T20 flat head screws from each of the left and right plastic parts
  of the acoustic cover. Place these screws in bin B1.</li>

<li>Remove vacuum hose - lifting up the hose from the metal tube at the
  milling head.</li>

<li>Remove 3 Torx T20 screws from the top of the back cover. Place these screws in bin B2.</li>

<li>Remove 2 Torx T20 screws and lock washers from each side of the bottom vertical
  brackets holding up the plexiglass & metal top. Place these screws in bin
  B3. Remove the plexiglass & metal top.</li>

<li>Remove 3 flat head Torx T20 screws from ach side of the plastic covers of the
  machine. Place these screws in bin B4.</li>

<li>Loosen top metal T25 screws - that act as a hinge for the top metal cover
  of the ProtoMat. Remove black plastic push pins from this top cover. Rotate
  cover back this reveals the cables that run to the Z-axis head. Place these
  screws in bin B5. See figure belows <img src="figure1.gif" alt="side
  view of machine with cover removed"><img src="figure2.gif"
  alt="view from above after removing the two push pins"></li>

<li>Remove the metal cover over the circuit board for the Z-axis. See two
  Torx T10 screws in the figure below. Note that you also have
  to remove the two screws on the front side (as seen facing the head) - to
  get the cover to release cleanly - note that these screws simply hold the
  cover together. In the figure these have been replaced into where they were
  screwed into (beneath the cover) {so as not to loose the screws). Note that
  there is a slot along the top of this cover for the black ribbon cable and
  black round power cable to the LED.
  <img src="figure3.gif" alt="View of milling head, showing location
  of the screws that hold the cover on the small circuit board"></li>

<li>Remove the two Philips screws undered the black ribbon cable - to separate
  the cable chain from the Z-axis head. See figure below. <img
  src="cable-chain-philips.gif"  alt="Location of screws attaching the cable chain"></li>

<li>Remove the ground cables from the ground connection on the top of the
  Z-axis controller board using a T10 screw driver. Note that from the screw
  head coming inward there are two washers, then the lug for the round green ground cable,
  then another washer, then the lug for the grounding strap. See figures
  below. <img src="figure4.gif"  alt="view showing grounding cables
  connected to the circuit board"><img src="figure14.gif"
  alt="Grounding point on the circuit board"></li>


<li>Remove the two Torx T10 screws holding the heat sink into place. See figure
  below. <img src="heat-sink.gif" alt="Location of screws holding the
  headsink to motor assembly"></li>

<li>Remove the cables from the Z-axis controller board.<img

<img src="figure12.gif" alt="closeup of cable connection to the motor"><br>
Note notch on top of motor connector cable. See figure below.
<img src="figure13.gif" alt="very tight closeup of notch in the
connectors for the motor cable">
</li>

<li>Remove collet lever. See figures below. (Note this picture was taken before
  the removal of the heat sink.)
    <img src="figure9.gif" alt="Collet lever"><img src="figure10.gif"
  alt="end view of collect lever">.</li>

<li>Remove the three T20 fixing head bolts from deep in the block of the
  Z-axis milling head. See figure below. Place these screws in bin B6.
  (Note that this picture was taken before removal of the collet lever.)<br>

the motor and controller assembly"></li>

<li>Remove the Torx T10 screws holding circuit board fixture to block. Carefully slide the
  motor cable out of the slot. Place these screws in bin B7.</li>

<li>Remove circuit fixture (taking care not to get thermal paste on your hands).
  The block will look similar to the figure below.<br>
  <img src="figure16.gif" alt="view of motor assembly after removal of
  circuit board"></li>

<li>View of the back of the circuit board fixture.<br>
  <img src="figure17.gif" alt="back of circuit board - showing thermal
  paste"></li>

<li>Remove T20 screws that attach the depth limiter to the milling head. See
  figure for the shapes of these two different small blocks. Note that the
  bottom one can easily be reached from below. But getting to the top one
  requires removing the controller board! Place the lower depth limiter block
  in bin B8 and the upper depth limiter block in bin B9.<br>

<li>View of where the top depth limiter attachment is connected.<br>

  attachment block is removed"></li>

<li>The removed motor assembly. See two views below.<br>
<img src="figure21.gif"  alt="view of motor assebly from spindle point
of view"><img src="figure22.gif" alt="view of motor assembly from the side"></li>

<li>The depth limiter by itself. Note that the wire is soldered to the LED,
  this limits the ability to work with it attached to the motor assembly.
   Note that the wire is still connected to the light in the
  depth limiter. Be careful not to break this wire.

<P>On Tuesday 10 August 2010 the replacement motor mounted in its
mounting block arrived, and was installed on Wednesday 11 August 2010.</P>
