<TITLE>SmartBadge version 1</TITLE>
<H1>
SmartBadge version 1
</H1>

<P>"A SmartBadge is a wearable computer with an infrared data link and
a collection of environmental sensors. It is designed to be work like
a corporate identity badge. The SmartBadge communicates with fixed
Badge Tranceivers using a subset of the IrDA IrLAP protocol
stack. Every 2.3 seconds the SmartBadge broadcasts a message giving
its identity and details of the state of its sensors.  A Badge
Treanceiver picks up the message and forwards it to a Badge Server
which de-encapsulates the Badge data from the IrLAP frame and forwards
the information to a Location Server that tracks the location and
state of Badges, Treanceivers and people." (From the lab notes for the
course.)</P>

<P>The first version of the SmartBadge has been used in classes at KTH
(Mobile Personal Communications module of the Telecommunications
"finger" course during Spring 1997) and University of Wollongong
(during Summer 1997). This version was mainly designed during winter
1997 by Dr. H. W. Peter Beadle, then of the The Institute for
Telecommunications Research, Electrical and Computer Engineering,
University of Wollongong, Australia in cooperation with M. T. Smith of
HP Labs and G. Q. Maguire Jr. of KTH.
</P>

<P>This version used a 2 layer circuit board made by Mark T. Smith of
HP Labs using a PCB milling machine.</P>

<P><A HREF="badge1-front.jpg">Front</A> and <A HREF="badge1-back.jpg">Back</A> Badge views</P>

<P>The basic system consists of an EEPROM programmable 20MHz 8 bit PIC
microcontroller with A/D Converter (PIC16C74-JW) and a number of
sensors.</P>

<H3>SmartBadge Programs</H3>

<P>SmartBadge (Version 1.1, C for PIC 16C74A-JW @ 20MHz) (Version 1.1, C for PIC 16C74A-JW @ 19.660800MHz)</P>

<UL>
<LI>All Badge communication is at 9600 baud, 8 data bits, one start bit,
one stop bit, no parity.</LI>

<LI>On power-up the badge beeps and waits for its ID to be programmed
across the IrDA link. When it starts up it sends a version number
string followed by a 'P' it then attempts to read a character from the
IrDA link. If the character is an 'i' it then tries to read four
additional characters that are the badge address. If anything other
than 'i' is read then the Badge sends another 'P' and waits for
another 'i'. After the initial 'i' you have 2.3 seconds to enter each
succeeding character. If the Badge is not programmed after 20 seconds
it assigns a default badge ID of 0xFFFF and starts operation. The
Programmer program in the PC Support Programs effectively programs the
badge to a definable ID.</LI>

<LI>Once the Badge ID is programmed the SmartBadge program checks the
tranceiver jumper on the Badge board and decides if it is going to
operate in Badge mode or Tranceiver mode.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Badge Mode</H4>

<P>Once operational the Badge polls its sensors, sends a Badge frame and
then waits for 1 second for incoming Badge command frames. It then sleeps
for 2.3 seconds and repeats the process. If an incoming Badge command frame
is recognised the command is executed and the badge resets its timeout
and waits for additional commands for 1 second. Back-to-back commands are
thus possible without the Badge going to sleep.</P>

<H4>Tranceiver Mode</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Turns a Badge with Daughter Card into a null-modem converting between
IrDA physical and RS232 physical one character at a time.</LI>
</UL>


<P>All the badge code was developed using PICSTART-16C - a PIC development environment.</P>


<H3>Badge Server</H3>

<P>Badge Server takes IrDA IrLAP frames delivered from a Badge Tranceiver
across the Internet. Parses the content and then forwared the data to the
WWW based Location Server as a HTML message. The program is also capable
of forwarding IrLAP frames data back to the Badge Tranceiver to be passed
on to a Badge.</P>

<H3>Badge Tranceiver</H3>

<P>Reads badge data from the serial port of a PC (Presumably from a Badge
running the tranceiver program) and sends it to a badge Server runing somwhere
in the Internet. The program can also receives IrLAP format frames from
the Internet and send them to the Badge through the serial port.</P>

<H3>Locator</H3>

<P>Allows a person to register with the Location Server on the Interner
when they log on to a computer.</P>

<H3>Programmer</H3>

<P>Allows the Badge ID to be programmed on Badge power-up. Programming
sequence is the character i followed by 4 bytes giving the Badge ID. You
can also type this in from an IrDA equiped notebook (e.g. OmniBook). Repeat
until the badge beeps at you or 20 seconds expire at which time the baged
starts up with a broadcast address of 0xffff.</P>

<H3>Fake Badge</H3>

<P>Allows you to specify the Badge address, Badge Tranceiver address and
send an update message to the Location Server as if the Badge had been
seen by the Tranceiver.</P>
