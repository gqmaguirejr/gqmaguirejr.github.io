<H1>Quotes about Professor Gerald Q. "Chip" Maguire Jr.</H1>


<hr>
<h2>Teacher of the year (2006/2007) award from the IT section of the KTH
student union</h2>

<p>On 7 September 2007, Erik R&aring;lenius, President of the Chapter of
Information Technology, Student Union at the KTH Royal Institute of
Technology, gave the following statement of the motivation for
this award as teacher of the year:</p>

<blockquote>
"Gerald Maguire is a teacher to be followed by his colleagues. His
teaching stands for high quality knowledge and he inspires with
colorful and enthusiastic examples. Gerald has also worked to improved
the quality of our courses and program. We acknowledge Gerald Maguire
as our teacher of the year"
</blockquote>


<h2>Gerald Q. Maguire (KTH, Sweden) talk at GMD Fokus</H2> <P>quoted
from
<A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/internet/notes.html">
"Random Internet Notes"</A> by Henning Schulzrinne:</P>

<blockquote>
"Multicast file distribution for updating electronic student notebook;
GPS for location-dependent processing. NCR WaveLAN has 1, need >= 2
spreading codes to allow switching for improved bandwidth, smooth
hand-off, different rates through different-length spreading codes,
redundancy for error compensation. MINT (mobile internet router)
attaches to Ethernet port and has its own processor; SNMP manager for
radio (power management); add API for callbacks for bandwidth change
(-> application control!), delay, battery about to go, ... desk area
wireless networks (around 1 m) for interconnecting equipment; body
area network for connecting phone, pager, etc. Body as power
source. (06/23/95)"

<h2>Regarding Webnet96</H2>
<P>quoted from
<A HREF="http://www.aace.org/conf/webnet/pubrep.html">
"Visions of the Future in New Media"</A> by Gary Gach 
(Reprinted from American Reporter)</P>

<blockquote>
<P>
"Besides very specialized speeches ranging from sharing a Website for a
class in dream study to one on the role of gender online, there were
some strong generalists. (As Howard Gossage, grandfather of
generalism, once said, "We don't know who it was discovered water, but
we're pretty sure it wasn't a fish.") Gerald "Chip" Maguire, for
example, delivered a brilliant keynote speech, "Glimpses of the Future
of Computer Networks." Assume all communication will be digital -- the
way computers work -- he says.</P>

<P>
Now imagine all communication devices as being mobile, and on the Net,
for work, for learning, and for home. So, for example, you're in your
car on the freeway and you want to know the traffic pattern in the
cloverleaf ahead: there's a panel in your car that can show you the
exact picture, car-by-car, via the Net.</P>

<P>
Maguire went on to demonstrate "heads-up" devices worn like
glasses. Animal rights activists might want to leave the room when I
report that scientists are experimenting with connecting Net-centric
fibers to the eyes of living cats.</P>

<P>Is the future of mobile computing to be implantable walkstations?
Well, it's just one of many, many avenues explored by the likes of
WebNet, a crossroads of the future."</P>

<H3><I>Glimpses of the Future of Computer Networks</I></H3>
<B>Gerald Maguire (Royal Institute of Technology, Teleinformatics, Stockholm, Sweden)</B>

<P>More than any other presentation I witnessed, this one left
audience members with their eyes glazed over.  The current state of
technology was used as a watch tower from which to gaze into the
future, both immediate and long range.  Maguire offered these
speculations:</P>

<UL>
<LI>FAX operator business will drop sharply as affordable, quality
printers appear on most desktops.</LI>

<LI>Cellular phone Internet access is coming.</LI>

<LI>Telecommuters may become the norm someday for those with typical
office jobs.  Technology will make this possible, but, in the end,
going to an office may be more efficient depending on the distractions
at home.</LI>

<LI>LANs will take over connectivity: there will be no more PBXs.</LI>

<LI>VANs (Vehicle Area Networks), DANs (Desk Area Networks), and BANs
(Body Area Networks) will enter our lexicon to join WANs (Wide Area
Networks) and LANs (Local Area Networks).  In a BAN, for instance,
pagers, cell phones, laptops, etc., will be networked.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Maguire ended by discussing the possible power sources for BANs.
Walking may generate the power for such networks, though he did
mention motor cortex implants as well, causing more than a few people
to squirm in their seats.</P>

Toch was de conferentie niet alleen maar serieus. Zo testte Gerald
Maguire van de Royal Institute of Technology in Zweden de
lichtgelovigheid van zijn publiek met zijn speculatieve presentatie
'Technologies for Portable Applacation: Toward the Inplantable
Walkstation'. Hij schetste een surrealistisch beeld met onder andere
chirurgisch geimplanteerde geluidsontvangers en antennes, toetsenbord
datagloves en monitoren bevestigd aan brilmonturen. Als
stroomvoorziening ziet hij batterijen in de toekomst vervangen door
gebruikmaking van 'bodypower'; energie gegenereerd door lopen, ademen,
zweten, etc. Het ging hem bij dit alles niet zozeer om de hoe-vraag
maar meer om 'Wanneer?'. Hij verzekerde zijn toehoorders dat binnen
twintig jaar telefoons, televisies, radio's en PC's alleen nog in
musea te vinden zijn...

<H3>Making personal communications more personal</H3>

<blockquote>
<P>"Starner's approach, which is focused on augmenting human
abilities by computing technology, clearly contrasts to the work like
Normann's, which is largely focused on replacing lost or missing human
functionality. Somewhere in the middle is G. Q.  (Chip) Maguire, a
Professor at The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. Maguire
believes that wearable computers have the same problem of bandwidth as
EEG-controlled computers, and that the only way to get a usable
human-computer interface is by using direct neural interfaces. Maguire
suggests that future computing and communications systems using neural
interfaces would allow us to have a system installed inside our head
which provides voice communications and an 'eyes-up' windowing system
which would create, via computer-controlled stimulation of the brain,
information in the form of text and pictures superimposed on our
normal vision. All of this would be connected to a wireless Body Area
Network (BAN) which provides communications between various personal
computing devices.</P>

<P>Maguire's view is that we should enhance our abilities and not
only replace lost ones, and the issues are much more about the
creation of true cyborgs than Starner's wearable computers. Maguire
suggests that people will willingly undergo the surgery that
neurocompatible computers require, even though the first users might
in fact be those with a disability. However, he also suggests that one
of the first groups of able-bodied volunteers would the professional
military, where the use of an implanted computing and communication
device with new interfaces to weapons, information, and communication
systems could be life-critical. The next group might be those involved
in information- intensive business who might use these devices to
develop an expanded information transfer capability. Initial
prototypes for neurally interfaced computers, Maguire predicts, will
be around in 5 years, with military systems appearing in 10 years, and
wider adoption within 20-30 years. Like Starner, Maguire sees the
benefits in terms of persistence and consistency - your on- board
computing systems will interface with different computers in the
environment to accomplish tasks such as withdrawing cash from an ATM,
checking-in at the airport, all without the need to learn new
interfaces or speak different languages.</P>

<P>If Maguire's predictions are accurate, and we are only 20 years
away from being offered the opportunity to enhance ourselves using
neurocompatible interfaces and computers, what are the problems we
will need to solve in the meantime? Aside from any moral and ethical
objections (of which there are too many to count) taking the concept
of the cyborg seriously at a technological level raises many
issues. For example, if we have embedded systems in our brains, then
ensuring the quality and reliability of both hardware and software
becomes critical. As does the issue of upgradability. What happens
when there is a new hardware upgrade or a new software release? What
happens when a design error is discovered which could lead to
life-threatening consequences? What manufacturer would offer
unconditional warranties on our neurocompatible systems, and would we
need in-patient surgery to replace damaged systems? Would Microsoft
BrainDriver be replaced by BrainDriver2095?</P>

<h2>SIME97</H2>

<P><A HREF="http://sime97.sime.org/documentation/technology.html">
"Technology Forecast - Looking Into The Crystal Ball"</A> - from the
Scandinavian Interactive Media Event1 - 1997</P>

<blockquote>
<P> ...<br>
"Gerald Q. Maguire spoke about the necessity of high
bandwidth. Already this year he hoped to have access to 51 Mb, but the
big change will occur in 1998, when we will begin to see high
bandwidth coming to mobile phones, something that he coined Vehicle
Area Networks (VAN). We will also start to build user-centered
systems, and in the not-to-distant future, mobile multimedia will be
available to users at the same price as over the regular phone
system. A key driver will be the price of technology, such as base
stations (the senders and receivers in the mobile phone
system).</P>

<P>But there is another problem with high bandwidth
communication: our ability to receive information.
Today we are able to process information at a rate of
approximately 150 kbps, which should be compared
to the gigabits that can be delivered to us. This ability
to process information will increase with the help of
gadgets like glasses with information displayed in
front of our eyes, much like in modern fighter
aircraft. He also presented the vision of direct neural
connection to the information flow, and concluded
that everything we know about interaction will
change.</P>

<P>Maguire also said the he thought that the much
touted smart cards are actually stupid, and that we
will see other types of cards in the future.</P>

<h2><A NAME="PersonalInterests">Personal Interests</A></H2>

<P>Occasionally I am ask what my personal interests are. I think the
text below summarizes it well.</P>

<P>When I became a professor here at KTH, they had a formal
installation ceremony in the city hall in conjunction with the
awarding of the year's doctoral degrees. When each of the new
professors is introduced Prof. Janne Carlsson, the rector (president)
of KTH, says what the person is known for and then tries to tell
something "personal" about them. So a couple weeks before the ceremony
I got e-mail from either he or his secretary asking if there was
something he could say about me. Generally people mention their
family, hobbies, and interests. I said I would have to check with my
wife first -- so I wrote her a note with my suggested description
which she agreed with, but didn't think the rector should say this
"true though it was". So when he reaches my name he introduces me and
my subject area and then he says:</P>

<blockquote>
    <P>As for interests other than work:</P>

    <P>In addition to work on mobile computation and communication systems,
    Gerald Q. "Chip" Maguire Jr. has done extensive work on medical
    imaging, as well as picture archiving and communication - which
    combines telecommunication with image processing systems. Most of this
    work has been done in collaboration with his bestest friend (and
    wife). Their third book on radiation protection for the health
    sciences is just about to come out.</P>

    <P>Chip's real interest is "Bright, Buxom, and Beautiful women"
    especially those over 40 who love to dance.</P>

    <P>His wife said that I shouldn't say this "true though it is".</P>
