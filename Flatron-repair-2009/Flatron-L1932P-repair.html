<TITLE>LG Flatron L1932P repair</TITLE>
<H1>LG Flatron L1932P repair</H1>

<p>In mid-August 2009 my LG Flatron L1932P display failed, the appearance was that the
display would turn on for a few seconds, then the screen would go dark. The
description below shows how to remove the power supply (mains to DC converter)
in order to replace the capacitor that has failed.
</p>

<p>This page attempts to describes what I did, but only for informational
  purposes. <em>It is only for use by those know how to repair power supplies.</em>
</p>


<ol>
<li>The zeroth step was to disconnect all the external cables from the
display. This includes the mains power -- for those who missed the
<em>all</em> cables part of the previous sentence.</li>

<li>The first step was to remove the four screws attaching the display to the pedestal.</li>

<li>The next step was put a beach towel on the table and put the display
  face down on it.<br>
<IMG SRC="turned-over-face-down.jpg"  ALT="image of display turned face down with peadistal removed">
</li>

<li>Next remove the screw holding the back of the case to the power
  supply/logic case (you can see it in the center of the space between the four screws that were used
  to attach the pedestal.</li>

<li>At this point it is time to remove the bezel from the monitor. Note that
  you have push in the plastic catches - as shown in the figure. You will need
  a sharp blade to go around the back of bezel to carefully push in the small
  ridge that holds the bezel on.<br>
<IMG SRC="turn-over-remove-bezel.jpg" ALT="image of the plastic catch on the lower lefthand corner of the display when placed face down on a table">. Notice that there is one plastic catch located near the power supply
button on the lower lefthand corner (shown in the figure) and another on the lower right hand corner.</li>

<li>Removing the back reveals the power and other control buttons on a small
  circuit board attached via a cable to the power supply. You can remove this
  button module by unscrewing the two screws, that hold it in place.<br>

</li>

<li>The power supply is mounted on the back of the LCD panel.<br>
<IMG SRC="power_supply_mounting.jpg" ALT="power supply mounted on the back of the LCD panel">
</li>

<li>The next step is to remove the shiny metal cover from the corner of the
  power supply, this gives you access to the power connection to the backlight.<br>
<IMG SRC="power_to_backlight1.jpg" ALT="connections from power supply to backlight">
</li>

<li>The image below shows the connectors on the cable to the backlight.<br>
<IMG SRC="cable-to-backlight1.jpg" ALT="conenctors for cable to backlight">
</li>

<li>There is a similar shiny metal cover at the top of the power supply. Note
  that the cables are in the mirror arrangement (i.e., the cable with the two
  blue wires is to the outside of the power supply case in both cases, while
  the conenctor with the gray and black cable is to the inside in both cases.)<br>

<li>Detailed view of the connectors on the cables to the backlight from the top
  of the power supply case.<br>

</li>

<li>Next remove the tape from over the cable from logic in the power
  supply case to LCD panel. Note how the cable exists the power supply/logic case.<br>

<li>The image belows shows the logic cable to the panel, after bing removed
  from the connector.<br>
<IMG SRC="logic-cable-to-panel.jpg" ALT="logic cable to panel">
</li>

<li>With all the cables now removed, remove the tape at the side of the
  powersupply and logic module and turn the module towards you, it will look
  like this:<br>
<IMG SRC="powersupply-and-logic-module.jpg" ALT="powersupply and logic module">
</li>

<li>With the module in this position we can see the underside of the connector
  on the cable to the panel.<br>

</li>


<li>Removing the black plastic cover reveals the mains to DC converter.<br>

</li>

<li>An alternative view of the logic module from above showing the mains supply
  to DC converter in the middle. Note the four screws holding the power supply
  (mains to DC converter) into the chassis. You will have to remove these
  screws to remove this module. Before removing this module we will take a
  look at the suspect capacitor in the DC converter and the cables that can be
  removed to make it easy to remove this module.<br>

<li>Closeup of view of capacitors of the DC converter. Note the slight bulge in
  the capacitor in the middle of the picture.<br>
<IMG SRC="closeup-of-caps2.jpg" ALT="closeup of view of capacitors of the DC converter">
</li>

<li>When view from the side we can see that this capacitor is sticking up a bit
  higher than the capacitor above it (C204). It is also possible to see the
  vent split apart a little.<br>
<IMG SRC="closeup-of-caps3.jpg" ALT="closeup of view of capacitors of the DC converter">
</li>


<li>Take a close look at the connector for power to logic board - so that you
  will be able to put this cable back into the connector properly when
  reassembling the unit.<br>

<li>The other end of the power cable to the logic board connects as shown
  below. You do <em>not</em> need to remove this cable to remove the DC converter.<br>

<li>Note also the connector on the logic board running to the button module.

</ol>

<p>
The failed capacitor was a 680 microFarad (680µF)  25V capacitor. After desoldering it from
the board, it was clear why it was sticking up higher than the equal height
capacitor beside it, the plastic seal was being pushed out past the crimped
end by internal pressure. I replaced this capacitor with a new
<a href="http://products.nichicon.co.jp/">Nichicon</a> Aluminum
Electrolytic capacitor HE Series (UHE1E681MPD) rated at 7000 Hrs @ 105°C. Such a capacitor is
available as (<a href="http://www.digikey.com">Digikey</a> part number 493-1554-ND).
Their catelog price on 19 August 2009 was 0.66 each (or 10 for $4.83).</p>

<p>Note when inserting the replacement capacitor to align the polarity just as
  the capacitor that you are replacing. An advantage of taking
  pictures of the circuit board before attempting any repair is that you can go
  back to see how the original part was oriented.</p>

<p>
In addition to this the other capacitors in this section are:
two 1000UF 25V, 470UF 25V, two 1000UF 16V. However, they did not need to be replaced.
</p>

<p>
After replair, the circuit board was replaced by reversing the order of the
steps above. The monitor works once again.
