<H1>TAP master instuctions for programmers</H1>

<P>Based on e-mail from <A HREF="mailto:msmith@it.kth.se">Mark Smith</A>
&lt;msmith@it.kth.se&gt; (during the course) and &lt;msmith@&gt; <br>
edited into HTML by G. Q. Maguire Jr. &lt;maguire@it.kth.se&gt;</P>

<P>Mark Smith has designed an IEEE Std 1149.1 (JTAG) Test Access Port (TAP)
master board so we can initially program the flash and also to help debug
the Badge3 boards. The information here should be enough for an individual
to start writing code to support the TAP master board. Whoever starts writing
code should send Mark e-mail for any extra information needed.</P>

<P>The TAP master board is an ISA card that plugs into a PC backplane and
connects to Badge3 via a cable going to its 10 pin JTAG connector. The
ISA card is I/O mapped only, and is centered around the Texas Instruments
74LVT8980 TAP master controller. TI referes to their xxLVT8980
as an embedded test-bus controllers (eTBC). "LVT" seems to stand for Low
VolTage - in that it can handle both 3.3 and 5 V devices.</P>

An excellent
primer on IEEE Std 1149.1 JTAG</A> is available at TI.

<P>A boundary scan architecture is roughly shown below:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="BoudaryScan-figure-1.gif" ></P>

<P>The Test Access Port (TAP) is controlled by the Test Clock (TCK) and
Test Mode Select (TMS) inputs. The TMS determines if we are going to scan
the data path or if we are going to scan the instruction register. TMS
and TDI are sampled on the rising edge of TCK, while TDO is sampled on
the falling edge.</P>

<P>There are six steady states to the TAP state machine: Test-Logic-Reset,
Run-Test/Idle, Shift-DR, Pause-DR, Shift-IR, and Pause-IR. The device under
test is placed into <B>Test-Logic-Reset</B> when TMS is asserted and 5
or more TCK cycles are performed. The state machine is shown below:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="BoudaryScan-figure-2.gif" ></P>

<P>As one can see from the state machine, after the Capture-DR or Capture-IR
state (which causes a parallel load of all the elements of the buckets
of the shift register) you can do a series of Shift-DR or Shift-IR sequences
to shift the caputred date out to TDO. Similarily you can via a series
of shifts bring in a set of bits from TDI and then do a Update-DR or Update-IR
(which causes a parallel load of all the outputs). Of course it is not
quite this simple - as there is more than one data register and you have
to use operations on the instruction register to selection on of the following
data registers:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Bypass Register - a 1 bit register than just connects TDI to TDO, in order
to bypass this device.</LI>

<LI>Boundary-Scan Register - the boundary-scan register is a series of boundary
scan cells, which are interconnected to form a scan chain around the entire
chip.</LI>

<LI>
optional: Device Identification Register
	    <UL>
	      <LI>bits: 31..28 Version</LI>
	      <LI>bits: 27..12 Part Number</LI>
	      <LI>bits: 11..1 Identity</LI>
	      <LI>bits: 0 fixed (always "1")</LI>
	    </UL>
</LI>

<LI>optional: Device Specific Test Data Register</LI>
<LI>optional: Device Specific Test Data Register</LI>
<LI>optional: Device Specific Test Data Register</LI>
</UL>

<P>Upon Reset the Instruction register is set to the IDCODE instruction if it is available
otherwise the it is set to the Bypass instruction.</P>

<h3>Instructions</H3>

<P>There are none test instructions (of which 6 are optional). </P>
<UL>
<LI>BYPASS instruction - selects the
	    bypass register; all ones in the instruction register</LI>

<LI>SAMPLE/PRELOAD - selects the boundary scan data register; the bit code is
	    vendor specific.</LI>

<LI>EXTEST (EXternal TEST)- selects the boundary-scan register, causess the test data to be
	    drive off-chip and receives test data from off chip; the bit code
	    was all zeros, but due to problems with stuck at zero faults it is
	    no longer required to be all zeros.</LI>

<LI>optional: INTEST - INTernal TEST mode; bit
	    code is vendor specific</LI>

<LI>optional: RUNBIST - RUN Built-In Self Test; bit
	    code is vendor specific</LI>

<LI>optional: CLAMP - sets the outputs of the chip to the contents of the
	    boundaryscan register, note that subsequently the boundary -scan
	    register can be shifted without changing the chips outputs; bit
	    code is vendor specific</LI>

<LI>optional: HIGHZ - set all the outputs to high impedence state and selects
	    the bypass data register;  bit code is vendor specific </LI>

<LI>optional: IDCODE - allows the chip to be in its functional mode, but
	    selects the device identification register as the data register;
	    bit code is vendor specific</LI>

<LI>optional: USERCODE allows the chip to be in functional mode and selects the
	    device identification data register and captures user-defined
	    iformation about the IC; bit code is vendor specific</LI>
</UL>

<P>The configuration of a chip can be define in a Boundary-Scan
Description Language (BSDL).  BSDL is a subset of VHDL (VHSIC Hardware
Description Language) that describes how IEEE 1149.1 is implemented in
a device and how it operates and which input/outputs are where (via
the Boundary Register Description which contains a list of
boundary-scan cells). </P>

<P>See Texas Instruments JTAG web page and the web in general for more
information about IEEE STD 1149.1 JTAG. Which includes a JTAG
Testability Primer. There is also a interactive tutorial Scan
Educator</A> for MS-DOS.</P>

<H2>As a FLASH programer</H2>

<P>The board works as a FLASH programmer on the badge by using the JTAG scan
chain in the badge's StrongARM processor. The basic idea is that the JTAG
scan chain allows one to serially clock bits into the StrongARM, in effect
1 bit per pin. After you have clocked in a bit for all the pins on the
StrongARM that can output, the JTAG circuits cause all the pins to assert
their mapped bits at once. By doing this over and over, you can very slowly
cause write cycles to happen to the FLASH. We only have to do this once
for a new badge to get appropriate boot code into the FLASH. After that,
the StrongARM can reprogram the FLASH itself.</P>

<H2>For in-circuit debugging</H2>

<P>The JTAG scan chain is also very useful to help debug the badge, by allowing
other things to be read or written to like the SRAM. On the badge, the
only device that supports a JTAG scan chain is the StrongARM processor.</P>

<P>For programmers to write successful code for the TAP master, they need
to know at least 4 things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The I/O mapping of the TAP master ISA card into the PC's I/O space.</LI>

<LI>The target hardware schematic in order to know what processor pins communicate
with what memory and I/O devices.</LI>

<LI>The mapping of the JTAG Scan Chain register bits in the processor to the
pins, and which pins support write only, read only and both read/write.</LI>

<LI>How the TAP master controller works, in this case the TI 74LVT8980.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Here is the information for these 4 items.</P>

<H2>Item #1: The I/O mapping of the TAP master ISA card into the PC's I/O space.</H2>

<P>The mapping for the ISA card in the PC's I/O space are shown below. Note
that addresses are in HEX.</P>

<PRE>
BASE address = 0x300 default

BASE+0x00 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 0
BASE+0x01 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 1
BASE+0x02 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 2
BASE+0x03 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 3
BASE+0x04 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 4
BASE+0x05 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 5
BASE+0x06 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 6
BASE+0x07 : 74LVT8980 internal register at address 7

BASE+0x08 : Gate controlling the CS pin on the badge FLASH memory and
            controlling the RST pin on the 74LVT8980.
</PRE>

<P>How to write code for BASE+0x00 through BASE+0x07 should become clear after
reading the 74LVT8980 data sheet. For BASE+0x08, data bit D0 maps to the
CS pin on the flash memory, and data bit D1 mapps to the RST pin on the
74LVT8980. Treat these pins as active high, i.e., writing to BASE+0x08 with
D0 set to 1 will assert CS on the FLASH. Writing with D1 set, the RST pin
on the 74LVT8980 will be asserted.</P>

<P>You may wonder why the address BASE+0x08 allows you to directly control
the CS pin on the FLASH. Can't one just control the CS pin on the FLASH
by writing the correct bit pattern to the JTAG register in the processor?
Yes you can, but by having a separate control to the CS pin by writing
to BASE+0x08, programming the flash is much faster as you don't have to
reload the entire scan chain just to toggle the CS pin on the FLASH. You
just load address and data into the scan chain, and toggle the CS pin using
BASE+0x08.</P>

<P>Note also that on the TAP master card itself, BASE is default mapped
to I/O address 0x300, but this can be changed on the card in case of address
conflicts. Code should be written in such a way that it can be easily changed
in case BASE is changed.</P>

<H2>Item #2: The target hardware schematic in order to know what processor
pins communicate with what memory and I/O devices.</H2>

<P>4 files in PDF format showing the complete badge schematic. They are:
<A HREF="processor.pdf">processor.pdf</A>,
<A HREF="memory.pdf">memory.pdf</A>,
<A HREF="sensors.pdf">sensors.pdf</A>, and
<A HREF="power.pdf">power.pdf.</A>.</P>

<H2>Item #3: The mapping of the JTAG Scan Chain register bits in the processor
to the pins, and which pins support write only, read only and both read/write.</H2>

<P>
This file (<A HREF="sa1100.jtg">sa1100.jtg</A>) is taken from the
hardware description language file defining the SA1100 StrongARM, so
it's somewhat hard to read, but it describes the mapping of the JTAG
Scan Chain register bits in the processor to the processor's pins and
which pins support write only, read only and both read/write.  Future
versions of the StrongARM SA-1100 data sheet should have this
information in it, but as of version 2.2, this information is
missing.</P>

<H2>Item #4: How the TAP master controller works, in this case the TI 74LVT8980</H2>

<P>This is the full data sheet for the <A HREF="74lvt8980.pdf">74LVT8980 TAP master controller</A>.
Take special note of the following:
<UL>
<LI>The RDY pin on the 74LVT8980 is not connected, so the board will not generate
wait states if the 74LVT8980 is not ready. I did this to avoid possible
problems this might cause with Windows 95 or NT. The software must check
the status registers in the 74lvt8980 and properly deal with not ready
situations.</LI>

<LI>The board does not generate interrupts. Everything must be done by software
polling.</LI>

<LI>Take special note of the errata item titled "Read of TDI buffer while it
is empty (not ready)" on page 32 of the 74LVT8980 data sheet. You will
probably have to follow the work around they suggest.</LI>
</UL></P>
